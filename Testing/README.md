Synergism automated testing relies on use of a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) environment.  Use of the most current LTS version is recommended.

Before running any tests, be sure to run a `npm install` from the command line / terminal so that the testing environment can be properly established.  The tests are currently configured to run against Firefox and Chrome, but this detail may be changed with relative ease.

I've made sure to somewhat heavily document the "basic" tests.  If you're fairly new to automated testing, please check out Testing/cases/basics.js.
