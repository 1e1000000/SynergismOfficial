Synergism automated testing relies on use of a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) environment.  Use of the most current LTS version is recommended.

Before running any tests, be sure to run a `npm install` from the command line / terminal so that the testing environment can be properly established.  The tests are currently configured to run against Firefox and Chrome, but this detail may be changed with relative ease.
